                Options at the right side of the dialog wheel usually advance a conversation, while options in the left side extends the conversation.\n\n
                If you want to check out all the paths a scene can offer, first try options on the left side.

                Responses at the *upper side* tend to be more kindheartedly (paragon rep.) while responses at the *lower side* tend to be more malicious (renegade rep.)\n\n
                Reputation stats (*Paragon*/*Renegade*) are not mutually exclusive, and might unlock some options later in the game...\n\n
